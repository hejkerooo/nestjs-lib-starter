# nestjs-lib-starter
[NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) library starter, helpful with creating new libraries for NestJS.

### Philosophy
While [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) community is growing, and it has it's own [Starter](https://github.com/unlight/nest-typescript-starter) I've decided to create starter pack for libraries.

### Testing locally
- Run `npm run build:test`
- Copy absolute path to generated `.tgz` file
- Run in other project `npm install <path_to_.tgz_file>`

### ToDo
- [] Create CLI to generate starter 
- [] Improve documentation
- [] Add examples
